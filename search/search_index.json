Contact your university library for more information. Data format and conversion \u00b6 BC Assessment provides data in XML and TXT format. To make the large XML files more accessible to researchers, UBC Library converts each to a series of CSV files and a SQLite database. Both the original files and the transformed versions are available in Abacus. The SQLite version is recommended for most users. For those interested in the file conversion, the process to create the SQLite database from the original XML and TXT files is outlined in these files: BCA_data_transformation_notes.txt describes the steps involved BCA_REVD_stylesheet.xsl is the XSLT stylesheet used in the transformation Using the sqlite database \u00b6 The open source DB Browser for SQLite is a good cross-platform tool for exploring and querying the SQLite version of the BC Assessment data: https://sqlitebrowser.org The database consists of 12 tables.

Joining tables \u00b6 Most users will need to join tables to access the data that interests them. The 10 tables derived from the Data Advice product can be joined on the folio_id field. The two tables derived from Inventory Extract products ( residentialInventory and commercialInventory ) do not have folio IDs but can be joined to the folio table using roll_number and jurisdiction . Important Roll numbers are unique within a jurisdiction but may be repeated across jurisdictions. When joining on roll_number also join on jurisdiction to avoid unintended results. Sales data \u00b6 The sales table contains data about the three most recent sales for each property in the database, regardless of when they occurred. The SQLite database for a given year includes most sales for that year but it does not necessarily provide a complete picture for previous periods. Each sale in the database is assigned a conveyanceType , a two digit code identifying the type of sale. The Data Advice user guide does not include information about conveyance types but the list below was provided by a BC Assessment employee via email (June 2022). Conveyance Type 4. Applied when more than one property is sold at the same time, multi properties together. Conveyance Type 5. Applied when the sale transaction does not meet the analysis criteria. To ensure valid and comparable, only sales in a competitive market without undue influence are included. Reasons for a sale to be excluded include related parties, partial ownership, estate sales, or multiple properties sold together. Conveyance Type 7. Applied when a property sold has an improvement (building) on it. Conveyance Type 8. Applied when a property sold is vacant (no improvements). Assessed property values \u00b6 The valuation table contains assessed values for each folio, reported as landValue and improvementValue . The value table contains similar information but with additional values for BC Transit and School purposes (see the valueType field). For most questions about assessed value use the valuation table. Some elements in the source XML are repeatable, including valuation. This means that one folio can have more than one entry in the valuation table (each with a different taxExemptCOde or propertyClassCode , for example). Consult the documentation and ensure your analysis accounts for multiple entries. SQL queries \u00b6 With the SQLite browser it's easy to filter tables and export to CSV, but SQL queries are the most efficient way to extract a subset of the data that fits your parameters. If you are new to SQL the W3Schools SQL Tutorial is a good place to learn the basics. abacusBCA package \u00b6 The abacusBCA R package created by Jens von Bergmann facilitates data access and basic processing of BC Assessment data hosted on Abacus for research purposes. It has the ability to conveniently download the data and open a local sqlite connection. Users will have to specify their own abacus API token as environment variable to use this.

Data with postal codes can be aggregated to standard geographies for reporting purposes or combined with other data available by Census geography (e.g. census tract, census subdivision). Note PCCF files do not contain any socioeconomic or demographic data themselves, they are just a key for aggregating or combining data files from other sources. Postal Code Conversion Files come in two flavours, the PCCF and PCCF+ . Postal Code boundaries do not perfectly match census boundaries: one postal code may span multiple census subdivisions, for example. The PCCF and PCCF+ differ in how they handle this kind of overlap. The PCCF file contains a Single Link Indicator (SLI) field to indicate the geographic area with the majority of dwellings assigned to a particular postal code. The PCCF+ is a SAS program using a population weighted random algorithm to increase accuracy where postal codes span over more than one geographic area from Queen's University Library's Guide to the PCCF/PCCF+ Which PCCF/PCCF+ file should I use? \u00b6 There are more than 50 PCCF/PCCF+ files in Abacus with different dates. This is because Postal Code and Census geographies change over time. Choose a PCCF/PCCF+ file with a Postal Code date as close as possible to the collection date of the data that contains the Postal Codes. Guides to the PCCF/PCCF+ \u00b6 Queens University Library maintains an excellent guide on PCCF and PCCF+ files, including step-by-step instructions for using the PCCF+ with SAS: https://guides.library.queensu.ca/PCCF/PCCF . PCCF helper scripts \u00b6 Recent PCCF files in Abacus include an SPSS syntax file to parse the data and assigns labels, making it easier to work with. Older PCCF records may only come with data files (e.g. this 2003 version ). When no syntax file is available researchers can use other tools to parse the data.

To help you start to navigate Abacus, here are some basic instructions on key activities and functions. If you already know the basics and wish to explore further, please see the search syntax page and the Advanced User's Guide . Login \u00b6 Your first login \u00b6 If you have never logged in to Abacus, when you log in for the first time from your institutional web page, you will be taken to the account creation page. Abacus will automatically create an account which uses information provided by your institution. Verify that your account details are correct and confirm them. Click on the Abacus logo at the top left of the page, and you will be able to use the Abacus service. Info You will only need to perform the above on your very first login. The primary Abacus web page is located at https://abacus.library.ubc.ca . Anyone may search Abacus and view the data descriptions but many data files can only be accessed by users affiliated with SFU, UBC, UNBC, or UVic. To work with these licensed files you will need to log in with your university credentials. If you have come directly to the Abacus home page, as opposed to navigating from your institution's library web site, follow these instructions to log in : SFU, UBC, and UNBC users UVic users Use the Log In link at the extreme right of the top menu bar. By default, you will be presented with a drop down list showing SFU, UBC, and UNBC. Select your institution and login using the credentials supplied by your university, such as the Campus-wide Login (CWL) used at the University of British Columbia. If the drop-down list of institutions is not visible and you are being prompted for username/password authentication, you will see Other options underneath the dialogue boxes, with a button labelled Your Institution . Clicking on this button will produce the drop-down list as described above. It is not necessary to select a username/password for Abacus , an account will be created for you the first time you login. Your institutional login ID is all that is required to access and download files to which your university has access. Login here using your university credentials. After login you will be redirected to the UVic collection in Abacus. Search \u00b6 This section introduces Abacus search options. For more information see the search syntax page. Default search \u00b6 Searching is possible from almost anywhere inside Abacus. From the main page at https://abacus.library.ubc.ca , the search feature will search the entire contents of Abacus, including material to which your institution may not have access. To easily limit your search to material to which your account has access, select your university from the icons at the top of the page. To limit your search to material that is available to the public without login, select the Abacus Open Data icon. Should your search produce too many results, it can be narrowed by selecting the facets on the left side of the page, such as \"Producer Name\". Facets may also be discarded once applied by clicking on them after they appear at the top of the search results. Selected search tips \u00b6 Boolean operators . By default, search terms are connected with the Boolean OR operator. Use AND between search terms if you would like results to contain all your terms: e.g. adult AND literacy AND education . Searching for phrases . Enclose search terms in double quotation marks to find records that contain the exact phrase: e.g. \"adult literacy\" . Be careful not to inadvertently exclude material of interest: for example, a search for \"adult literacy survey\" will return the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) , but not the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey . Wildcards . Abacus supports single- and multiple-character wildcards: ? to match one character. ?oom matches \"zoom\", \"room\", and \"boom\", but not \"broom\". * to match zero or more characters. revolution* matches \"revolution\", \"revolutionary\", and \"revolutionaries\". Info Wildcard operators function only on terms, not phrases. For more detail and additional tips see Search syntax . Advanced search \u00b6 The Advanced search will allow you to search by very specific individual fields and to search within the data itself for applicable datasets. Note that not all datasets have variable-level searching implemented, nor does every study in Abacus have every field filled, as some values are not applicable to some types of datasets. Local vs global search \u00b6 Abacus supports two distinct search scopes : \"global\" and \"local\". Using the search box on the left-hand side of the user interface will limit results to the dataverse currently selected (a \"local\" search), while using the search box through selecting the \"Search\" drop-down menu at the top of the user interface will execute a query on all dataverses in the Abacus Data Network (a \"global\" search, as shown below). Search syntax \u00b6 Boolean logical operators \u00b6 Boolean logical operators greatly improve the power and efficiency of queries. By default, search terms are connected with the Boolean OR operator. Thus, the search adult literacy survey will match material containing \"adult\", \"literacy\", or \"survey\", but not necessarily all three. For results that contain all search terms, use the AND operator: adult AND literacy AND survey . In addition to the AND and OR operators, other useful Boolean operators include NOT , + , and - . The NOT and - operators function similarly, requiring that the term following the operator not be present in search results, while the + operator requires that the term is present. For instance, literacy NOT child , or literacy -child , will return all results containing \"literacy\" without the term \"child\", while +\"adult literacy\" survey returns results with the phrase \"adult literacy\" that may or may not contain the term \"survey\". In addition to their word form, Boolean operators can also be called in symbol form: Word Symbol AND && OR || NOT ! Info To use Boolean operators in word form (e.g. AND , OR , NOT ), all letters must be uppercase. Additionally, when using the ! operator, unlike its word form NOT , do not include a space before the term it applies to. correct: education !primary incorrect: education ! primary . For added control over the Boolean logic of a search, users can group clauses to form sub-queries using parentheses. Searching for vaccine AND (\"corona virus\" OR \"COVID-19\") will return material that matches either \"vaccine\" and \"corona virus\" or \"vaccine\" and \"COVID-19\". Querying specific fields \u00b6 Users can also narrow their search within Abacus by querying specific fields . The syntax for this requires, first, specifiying the field to be searched (e.g. title ), followed by a : , and then the term to search for: title : financial . (NOTE: There is no space between the colon and the search term. ) Searching for multiple terms within a field requires specifying the field before each term. For example, the sytnax for searching for the terms \"labour\", \"force\", and \"survey\" within the \"title\" field is title : labour AND title : force AND title : survey . Using the query title : labour force survey will search for \"labour\" in the \"title\" field and \"force\" and \"survey\" in any other metadata field. To search for the phrase \"labour force survey\" in the \"title\" field, wrap the phrase in double quotation marks: title:\"labour force survey\" . Specifying a date range \u00b6 Searching by specifying a date range can also be an effective way to find data. Range syntax is denoted in Abacus as [ TO ] , where both a lower and upper bound are specified. Different types of brackets indicate whether these bounds are inclusive or exclusive. Square brackets [] represent inclusive lower and upper bounds, whereas curly brackets {} represent exclusive bounds. These can be combined in a single query: {1956-02-16 TO 1988-05-03] . Dates in Abacus are formatted as YYYY-MM-DD , where: YYYY is the year, MM is the month, DD is the day of the month, Truncation: Users do not need to specify complete dates and times to search using date ranges. For instance, the search pubdate:[1956 TO 1998-05] using the \"publication date\" field will produce relevant material from (and including) 1 January 1956 through 31 May 1998. Wildcard: You may use the * wildcard as the lower or upper bound. Entering [* TO 2001-09-11} would return all matched items from the earliest in the repository up to (but excluding) 11 September 2001, whereas entering [2001-09-11 TO *] would return all matched items from (and including) 11 September 2001 up to the most recent matched deposit. Download \u00b6 Once you've found a data set in the search, click on the title and you'll be taken to its page. By default, you are taken to a short display with an abstract and a listing of files. For each file, you may have several options, depending on its type. To quickly download the file, click on the Download button For statistical files which are available for online analysis, you can view their contents and download in a variety of formats by using the Explore button. You will also be able to view summary statistics for these data sets and create cross-tabulations, as well as search within the data set itself at the variable level. Linking and downloading individual files \u00b6 To see a preview (if available), permanent URL and other metadata for a particular file, click on the filename . The next page will provide citations for both the data set and the individual file , as well as a record of any changes to the file itself. The file may be downloaded by clicking the Download button. The metadata tab will may also provide a direct download link (if available), and display an md5 checksum should you wish to verify your download. If there is no direct download link, and programmatic access is required, the using the equivalent of the following curl commands will allow direct download. Publicly accessible data files \u00b6 As an example, the 2020 Labour Force Survey data: File page for the August 2020 ASCII data : https://dvn.library.ubc.ca/file.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:11272.1/AB2/GGXMM2/KMGN1A&version=2.0 To download this file: curl \"https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/api/access/datafile/:persistentId/?persistentId=hdl:11272.1/AB2/GGXMM2/KMGN1A\" -o micro2020-08.zip\" Licensed data \u00b6 To download licensed data, you will need an API token (see the Advanced User's Guide ) As an example, the CanMap Content Suite, v2019.3 : File page for the WatershedsRegion.zip file: https://dvn.library.ubc.ca/file.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:11272.1/AB2/PCTBFN/IBVPVN&version=1.0 To download this file: curl -H \"X-Dataverse-key: YOURAPITOKEN\" \"https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/api/access/datafile/:persistentId/?persistentId=hdl:11272.1/AB2/PCTBFN/IBVPVN\" -o WatershedsRegion.zip Where YOURAPITOKEN is your account's API token. Bulk downloads \u00b6 To download multiple files at once, select the checkbox at the left of the top row of the file table. This will automatically select all of the files in the study. Download the files using Download button on the top row of the table. For data sets with very large files, such as the geospatial datasets from DMTI Spatial Inc. or compilations of lidar or orthoimagery, downloads may be truncated due to size limits on zip files. Other download options are available, such as API based downloads (as per the Advanced User's Guide ). Metadata \u00b6 To view the metadata or detailed description of the material in Abacus, select the Metadata tab of the data set in which you are viewing. By default, citation metadata is visible, with other sections of metadata (such as Geospatial data) is only visible after clicking on the appropriate button. For many social science data sets, much of the metadata will be stored in the Social Science and Humanities Metadata section, such as sample information, etc. Study metadata can be exported in a variety of formats for use in other applications by selecting the format desired from the Export Metadata button found just above the citation metadata. Some formats can be used with citation managers, such as DataCite and Dublin Core, but import formats are dependent entirely on the citation manager software. Help/support \u00b6 For more detailed information beyond this brief guide, please see the Advanced User's Guide , which will give a detailed overview of the use of Dataverse, the software which powers Abacus. Support within Abacus itself is available as well. For email assistance, use the Support link in the interface menu bar. For support with specific data sets, or to report errors and technical issues, within each record you can use the Contact button just above and to the right of the dataset title.

For results that contain all search terms, use the AND operator: adult AND literacy AND survey . In addition to the AND and OR operators, other useful Boolean operators include NOT , + , and - . The NOT and - operators function similarly, requiring that the term following the operator not be present in search results, while the + operator requires that the term is present. For instance, literacy NOT child , or literacy -child , will return all results containing \"literacy\" without the term \"child\", while +\"adult literacy\" survey returns results with the phrase \"adult literacy\" that may or may not contain the term \"survey\". In addition to their word form, Boolean operators can also be called in symbol form: Word Symbol AND && OR || NOT ! To use Boolean operators in word form (e.g. AND , OR , NOT ), all letters must be uppercase. Additionally, when using the ! operator, unlike its word form NOT , do not include a space before the term it applies to--correct: education !primary , incorrect: education ! primary . For added control over the Boolean logic of a search, users can group clauses to form sub-queries using parentheses. Searching for vaccine AND (\"corona virus\" OR \"COVID-19\") will return material that matches either \"vaccine\" and \"corona virus\" or \"vaccine\" and \"COVID-19\".","title":"Boolean logical operators"},{"location":"en/guides/user/search/#search-scope","text":"Abacus supports two distinct search scopes : \"global\" and \"local\". Using the search box on the left-hand side of the user interface will limit results to the dataverse currently selected (a \"local\" search), while using the search box through selecting the \"Search\" drop-down menu at the top of the user interface will execute a query on all dataverses in the Abacus Data Network (a \"global\" search).","title":"Search scope"},{"location":"en/guides/user/search/#querying-specific-fields","text":"Users can also narrow their search within Abacus by querying specific fields . The syntax for this requires, first, specifiying the field to be searched (e.g. title ), followed by a : , and then the term to search for: title : financial . (NOTE: There is no space between the colon and the search term. ) Searching for multiple terms within a field requires specifying the field before each term. For example, the sytnax for searching for the terms \"labour\", \"force\", and \"survey\" within the \"title\" field is title : labour AND title : force AND title : survey . Using the query title : labour force survey will search for \"labour\" in the \"title\" field and \"force\" and \"survey\" in any other metadata field. To search for the phrase \"labour force survey\" in the \"title\" field, wrap the phrase in double quotation marks: title:\"labour force survey\" .","title":"Querying specific fields"},{"location":"en/guides/user/search/#specifying-a-date-range","text":"Searching by specifying a date range can also be an effective way to find data. Range syntax is denoted in Abacus as [ TO ] , where both a lower and upper bound are specified. Different types of brackets indicate whether these bounds are inclusive or exclusive. Square brackets [] represent inclusive lower and upper bounds, whereas curly brackets {} represent exclusive bounds. These can be combined in a single query: {1956-02-16 TO 1988-05-03] . Dates in Abacus are formatted as YYYY-MM-DD , where: - YYYY is the year, - MM is the month, - DD is the day of the month, Truncation: Users do not need to specify complete dates and times to search using date ranges. For instance, the search pubdate:[1956 TO 1998-05] using the \"publication date\" field will produce relevant material from (and including) 1 January 1956 through 31 May 1998. Wildcard: You may use the * wildcard as the lower or upper bound. Entering [* TO 2001-09-11} would return all matched items from the earliest in the repository up to (but excluding) 11 September 2001, whereas entering [2001-09-11 TO *] would return all matched items from (and including) 11 September 2001 up to the most recent matched deposit.","title":"Specifying a date range"}]}
